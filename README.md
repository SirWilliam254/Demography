# Demography

Demography is the scientific study of human populations, including their size, composition, distribution, and changes over time. It examines patterns of birth, death, and migration, as well as the social, economic, and environmental factors that influence these patterns. Demography also involves the use of statistical methods to analyze and interpret data on population characteristics, such as age, gender, race, ethnicity, education, and income. The information generated by demography is useful for understanding and addressing a wide range of social and economic issues, such as public health, education, labor markets, and housing.
